This project implements a Hybrid Search Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application that combines semantic vector search and 
keyword search methodologies. The application is designed to enhance the retrieval process by comparing the results of a hybrid search
approach with those obtained solely through semantic vector search. Pinecone is used as the vector database (VectorDB) for storing and querying embeddings.

**Features**
Hybrid Search Methodology: Combines the strengths of semantic vector search and keyword search to improve the accuracy and relevance of retrieved information.

Semantic Vector Search: Utilizes advanced embeddings for context-aware search.


Keyword Search: Incorporates traditional keyword matching to complement vector search.

Performance Comparison: Provides insights into the effectiveness of the hybrid approach by comparing it with purely semantic vector search results.

Pinecone VectorDB: Leverages Pinecone's powerful vector database for efficient storage and querying of embeddings.

**Research Basis**
This RAG application is based on the research presented in the paper "Effect of Aging on Tensile and Fracture Behavior of a Metastable Ti-15 V–3Cr–3Al–3Sn β-Titanium Alloy". 

DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jallcom.2024.175803

The methodologies and findings from this research paper are used to guide the development and evaluation of the hybrid search approach.
